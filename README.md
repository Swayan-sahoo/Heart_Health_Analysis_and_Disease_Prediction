Project 4 – Machine Learning Classification with Visualization
📌 Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to perform classification tasks on a dataset, enhanced with data visualization using tools like Plotly, Seaborn, and Dash. The notebook also leverages PySpark and advanced libraries for EDA and model building.

🧠 Objectives
Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize insights using Sweetviz, Plotly, Seaborn, and Waffle charts

Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Classifier

XGBoost

Integrate PySpark for large-scale data processing

Create visual dashboards using Dash and Plotly

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

PySpark (MLlib)

Sweetviz, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Dash & Dash Bootstrap Components

Folium, Waffle Charts

SQLite3 (for data storage)


📂 Files
Project_4_swayan.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with all code and outputs


📈 Results
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

Visuals are used throughout to improve interpretability of the results.

💡 Key Highlights
Combines traditional scikit-learn models with PySpark MLlib for scalability

Uses Sweetviz for automatic EDA reporting

Dash integration for interactive visualization

Rich visuals including waffle charts and geographic maps
