# Heart_Health_Analysis_and_Disease_Prediction
Project 4 ‚Äì Machine Learning Classification with Visualization
üìå Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to perform classification tasks on a dataset, enhanced with data visualization using tools like Plotly, Seaborn, and Dash. The notebook also leverages PySpark and advanced libraries for EDA and model building.

üß† Objectives
Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize insights using Sweetviz, Plotly, Seaborn, and Waffle charts

Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Classifier

XGBoost

Integrate PySpark for large-scale data processing

Create visual dashboards using Dash and Plotly

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
